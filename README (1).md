# 💧 Smart Irrigation System using AI & Cloud

This project is part of the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship**, supported by **Edunet Foundation**, **AICTE**, **Shell**, and powered by **IBM Cloud**.  
It aims to optimize water usage in agriculture using **AI**, **data analytics**, and **smart sensors** to promote sustainable and efficient irrigation.

## 🚀 Project Objective

To design and implement an intelligent irrigation system that:
- Analyzes environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
- Predicts irrigation needs using machine learning models
- Automates water distribution decisions
- Minimizes water wastage and improves crop yield

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**
- **IBM Cloud (Watson Studio, Cloud Object Storage, etc.)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **AI/ML models** for prediction and decision-making
